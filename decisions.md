# Architectural Decisions

This document explains the key architectural decisions made for the Calendar Challenge Flutter app and the reasoning behind them.

## 1. Clean Architecture Pattern

**Decision**: Implemented a clean architecture with clear separation between presentation, domain, and data layers.

**Why**:
- **Testability**: Each layer can be tested in isolation with mocked dependencies
- **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't cascade to others
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new features without affecting existing code
- **Separation of Concerns**: UI logic, business logic, and data access are clearly separated

**Implementation**:
```
lib/feature/calendar_view/
├── presentation/    # Widgets, providers, UI state
├── domain/         # Repository interfaces, business logic  
└── data/          # Repository implementations, data sources
```

## 2. Repository Pattern

**Decision**: Used repository pattern as the interface between domain and data layers.

**Why**:
- **Abstraction**: Domain layer doesn't know about data source implementation details
- **Flexibility**: Can easily switch between mock data, API calls, or local storage
- **Testing**: Easy to mock repositories in tests
- **Single Responsibility**: Each repository handles one data type (Location, Booking)

**Trade-offs**:
- Adds complexity for simple operations
- More boilerplate code
- But provides long-term maintainability benefits

## 3. Riverpod for State Management

**Decision**: Chose Riverpod over other state management solutions (Provider, Bloc, GetX).

**Why**:
- **Compile-time Safety**: Catches provider errors at compile time
- **No BuildContext**: Can be used anywhere in the app
- **Testing Support**: Built-in provider overrides for testing
- **Performance**: Efficient rebuilds only when dependencies change
- **Flutter Team Recommended**: Successor to Provider package

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Provider**: Less type-safe, requires BuildContext
- **Bloc**: More verbose, overkill for this app's complexity
- **GetX**: Not recommended by Flutter team, mixing concerns

## 4. Caching Strategy

**Decision**: Implemented different caching strategies for different data types.

**Location Data**: 5-minute cache with TTL
- **Why**: Location data changes infrequently
- **Benefit**: Reduces redundant API calls, improves performance

**Booking Data**: No caching, always fresh
- **Why**: Booking data is critical and changes frequently
- **Benefit**: Ensures data consistency, prevents booking conflicts

## 5. Widget Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Comprehensive widget tests with provider overrides and realistic test data.

**Why**:
- **Confidence**: Tests cover real user interactions
- **Regression Prevention**: Catch UI bugs before deployment
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as usage examples
- **Provider Testing**: Verify state management works correctly

**Testing Approach**:
- Mock all external dependencies
- Test user interactions (tap, swipe, refresh)
- Verify UI renders correctly with different data states
